# Dreams of Fire
My game jam game for Godot Community Game Jam - June 2018 The theme is *temperature*. I have decided to make two game worlds,
one 2D where you control a flame, and one 3D where you control a ice golem of sorts.

The code is pretty rough in some places, but the game works and is pretty fun too!

I did not create the following assets:

* The music is public domain, and was download from the public domain folder on [GameSounds.xyz](https://gamesounds.xyz/?dir=Public%20Domain)
* Mountains-of-christmas is licensed under the Apache License, and was downloaded from [Fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/mountains-of-christmas?filter%5Blicense%5D%5B0%5D=open&sort=popular)
* OpenSans is licensed under the the Apache License, and was downloaded from [Fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans?filter%5Blicense%5D%5B0%5D=open&sort=popular)
* The pallet used for the 2D and 3D art is Endesga and was downloaded from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list)

The rest of the assets were created by me (TwistedTwigleg).
