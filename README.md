# Dreams of Fire
My game jam game for Godot Community Game Jam - June 2018 The theme is *temperature*. I have decided to make two game worlds,
one 2D where you control a flame, and one 3D where you control a ice golem of sorts.

Nothing much to see right now. The game is (currently) in a bare bones state. The basics are working, and that is about
it. The code is pretty hastily written right now, as the jam is only three days. I'll clean up the code once the judging period
of the jam is over.

Some assets may use a different license (though I do not think there is any right now). **Please do not download and/or
redistribute right now! I will add all of the proper information for the various assets once the jam is over!**

Also, the game is very unstable right now, as I am still working on it!

All of the 2D and 3D art, minus the vignette texture and the white texture,
have been created by me (TwistedTwigleg) specifically for Godot Community Game Jam - June 2018.
